# Projects

Because of my short attention span, and the fact that I usually do this stuff to learn a tool, some of these are half-finished or specific to my own use cases.

## [Sneezly](https://github.com/eddiejessup/sneezly)

An event logging server using Django Channels and web sockets, designed for human input of low frequency events. It has a chat-bot front end that can be attached to Slack channels. Originally made to record my sneezes, along with possible causative events, to try to work out if there's a trigger. (I sneeze lots in the morning.) If you want to record a variety of mundane events, and you sit on slack all day, it works nicely.

## [NeX](https://github.com/eddiejessup/nex)

A grounds-up re-implementation of the TeX programming language in Python. Not just the parser, or the output routines, or the math language, the whole thing. Because the original-and-still-current implementation from the 1980s is a mess (sorry Don).

## [Transcrypt](https://github.com/eddiejessup/Transcrypt/projects)

A package for Sublime Text, to easily encrypt and decrypt files without leaving the editor.

## [My CV](https://github.com/eddiejessup/cv)

I think the way I make my CV is useful enough for me to be of general interest. I like to customize its contents for each job application, but I don't want to have to mess with LaTeX or HTML. CVs have a consistent structure, so I have a YAML file in which the actual contents live, which I then use to render HTML and LaTeX templates. The HTML goes on this website, the second to a PDF. It would be nice to do this with markdown, but I really haven't found a path from markdown that makes an acceptably beautiful document. And I like typesetting.
